# If enabled, vsftpd will run in standalone mode. This means that vsftpd must not be run from an inetd of some kind. Instead, the vsftpd executable is run once directly. vsftpd itself will then take care of listening for and handling incoming connections.
listen=YES

# When enabled, and vsftpd is started in "listen" mode, vsftpd will background the listener process. i.e. control will immediately be returned to the shell which launched vsftpd.
background=NO

# Controls whether anonymous logins are permitted or not. If enabled, both the usernames ftp and anonymous are recognised as anonymous logins.
anonymous_enable=NO

# Controls whether local logins are permitted or not. If enabled, normal user accounts in /etc/passwd (or wherever your PAM config references) may be used to log in. This must be enable for any non-anonymous login to work, including virtual users.
local_enable=YES

# If enabled, all non-anonymous logins are classed as "guest" logins. A guest login is remapped to the user specified in the guest_username setting.
guest_enable=YES

# If enabled, virtual users will use the same privileges as local users. By default, virtual users will use the same privileges as anonymous users, which tends to be more restrictive (especially in terms of write access).
virtual_use_local_privs=YES

# This controls whether any FTP commands which change the filesystem are allowed or not. These commands are: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE and SITE.
write_enable=YES

# This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.
pam_service_name=vsftpd_virtual

# This option is useful is conjunction with virtual users. It is used to automatically generate a home directory for each virtual user, based on a template. For example, if the home directory of the real user specified via guest_username is /home/virtual/$USER, and user_sub_token is set to $USER, then when virtual user fred logs in, he will end up (usually chroot()'ed) in the directory /home/virtual/fred. This option also takes affect if local_root contains user_sub_token.
user_sub_token=$USER

# This option represents a directory which vsftpd will try to change into after a local (i.e. non-anonymous) login. Failure is silently ignored.
local_root=/home/vsftpd/$USER

# If set to YES, local users will be (by default) placed in a chroot() jail in their home directory after login. Warning: This option has security implications, especially if the users have upload permission, or shell access. Only enable if you know what you are doing. Note that these security implications are not vsftpd specific. They apply to all FTP daemons which offer to put local users in chroot() jails.
chroot_local_user=YES

# If enabled, all user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".
hide_ids=YES

# If enabled, a log file will be maintained detailling uploads and downloads. By default, this file will be placed at /var/log/vsftpd.log, but this location may be overridden using the configuration setting vsftpd_log_file.
xferlog_enable=YES

# This option is the name of the file to which we write the wu-ftpd style transfer log. The transfer log is only written if the option xferlog_enable is set, along with xferlog_std_format. Alternatively, it is written if you have set the option dual_log_enable.
xferlog_file=/var/log/vsftpd/vsftpd.log

# Set to NO if you want to disallow the PORT method of obtaining a data connection.
port_enable=YES

# This controls whether PORT style data connections use port 20 (ftp-data) on the server machine. For security reasons, some clients may insist that this is the case. Conversely, disabling this option enables vsftpd to run with slightly less privilege.
connect_from_port_20=YES

# The port from which PORT style connections originate (as long as the poorly named connect_from_port_20 is enabled).
ftp_data_port=20

# The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to establish connection with a PASV style data connection.
accept_timeout=600

# The timeout, in seconds, for a remote client to respond to our PORT style data connection.
connect_timeout=600

# The timeout, in seconds, which is roughly the maximum time we permit data transfers to stall for with no progress. If the timeout triggers, the remote client is kicked off.
data_connection_timeout=600

# The timeout, in seconds, which is the maximum time a remote client may spend between FTP commands. If the timeout triggers, the remote client is kicked off.
idle_session_timeout=600

# The maximum data transfer rate permitted, in bytes per second, for anonymous clients.
anon_max_rate=0

# The maximum data transfer rate permitted, in bytes per second, for local authenticated users.
local_max_rate=0

# If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the maximum number of clients which may be connected. Any additional clients connecting will get an error message.
max_clients=0

# If vsftpd is in standalone mode, this is the maximum number of clients which may be connected from the same source internet address. A client will get an error message if they go over this limit.
max_per_ip=0

# This option should be the name of a directory which is empty. Also, the directory should not be writable by the ftp user. This directory is used as a secure chroot() jail at times vsftpd does not require filesystem access.
secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty
